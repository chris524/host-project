                    <p>Therapeutic massage is also known as Deep Tissue Massage. Therapeutic massage uses special techniques (Neuromuscular, Myofascial Release, and Sports massage) in order to release the  tightness in the soft tissue. The massage therapist needs to work deeper into the tissue and will use whichever therapeutic technique is most effective for the condition. In working deeper into the tissues, the focus is on actually correcting pain, problem or dysfunction of the body.</p>

                    <h3>Headaches</h3>
                    <p>There are approximately 45 million Americans complaining of headaches each year. Headaches are the most complained about the medical ailment. There are two types of headaches tension and migraine.</p>

                    <h3>TENSION HEADACHES</h3>

                    <p>Tension headaches have two categories episodic and chronic the difference is the length of symptoms.</p>

                    <h3>MIGRAINE HEADACHES</h3>

                    <p>Migraine Headaches are the second most common type of  headache. Around 16 to 17 percent of the population complains of migraines.</p>

                    <h3>TMJD</h3>
                    <p>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) acts like a sliding hinge, connecting your jawbone to your skull. Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD)can cause pain in your jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement. Temporomandibular joint disorders can be aggravated by clench or grind their teeth and jaw injury.</p>

                    <h3>Limited ROM</h3>
                    <p>Limited range of motion (ROM) is a condition that exists when a joint is unable to bend or otherwise impeded. Causes include pain, muscle stiffness and tissue swelling. As a result of this many conditions, including injury or other trauma, disease, and disuse. There are three types of range of motion exercises.</p>

                    <p>passive range of motion (or PROM) –  Joint is moved through the range of motion with no effort from the patient, the movement is done  by therapist or equipment .
                    active assistive range of motion (or AAROM) – Patient requires some help from the therapist or equipment (such as a strap).
                    active range of motion (or AROM) –  Joint moved without any assistance to the muscles surrounding the joint.</p>

                    <h3>Old injury/Scar tissue</h3>
                    <p>Scar tissue is made from  the inflexible fibrous material. This fibrous material binds itself to the damaged soft tissue fibers in an effort to draw back together the damaged fibers. Scar tissue is never as strong as the tissue it replaces. It also has a tendency to contract and deform the surrounding tissues. Further damage could result because the strength and flexibility of the tissue are compromised.</p>

                    <h3>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h3>
                    <p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a  condition that carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway located on the palm side of your wrist. This tunnel protects a main nerve to your hand and the nine tendons that bend your fingers that cause numbness, tingling and other symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by a pinched nerve in your wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be aggravated by the anatomy of your wrist and possibly patterns of hand use.</p>

                    <h3>Low Back pain</h3>
                    <p>The pain in the back may vary. It can manifest from a sensation of  dull, achy to sharp or stabbing. The severity of sensation will depend on the underlying cause of your back pain. Most people find that reclining or lying down will diminish the  low back pain, no matter the underlying cause. People with low back pain may experience some of the following that standing , bending , lifting and walking may  aggravate the back. Back pain comes and goes depending on the activity being performed.</p>

                   <h3>Runner’s Knee</h3>
                    <p>Runner’s knee also know as Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), got its nickname for an obvious and very unfortunate reason—it’s common among runners. PFPS symptoms  include tenderness of the patella usually toward its center but also felt behind or around it . You may feel the knee’s giving out, pain toward the back of the knee or a sense of cracking.  Runner’s knee  can be aggravated by steps, hills, and uneven terrain.</p>

                    <h3>Shin Splints</h3>
                    <p>Shin splints are also known as Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). It may be caused by an irritation of the muscles and tendons near the shin bones. Runners are most prone see this injury of muscle and bones of the lower leg. MTSS can be aggravated by exercise causing shin pain.</p>

                    <h3>Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
                    <p>Plantar fasciitis is caused by straining ligament  that supports your arch. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament. These strains can create  weak, swollen, and irritated (inflamed). Then your heel or the bottom of your foot hurts when you stand or walk. Plantar Fasciitis can be aggravated by high arches, flat feet or excessive pronation.</p>

                    <p>Relaxation Massage may also be called Swedish Massage is a well-being technique beneficial for relieving everyday stress, loosening any general tension in the muscle. The intention of relaxation massage is not to work on soft tissue(muscles, fascia, tendons, and ligament) many conditions that people have, such as chronic neck pain, back pain, wrist pain, injuries and limited range of motion. These conditions are typically caused by tension that is buried deep within the body.</p>

                    <p>The differences between therapeutic massage and relaxation massage are in the intent and regularity of work being done.</p>

                    <p>Therapeutic Massage since it involves working deeper into the soft tissue, that tissue will need a day or two of rest and recovery. A typical Therapeutic Massage schedule is for two to three sessions a week for a week or more to get the most progress and the best results. Relaxation massage can be performed every day because the work is superficial in the tissue.</p>
